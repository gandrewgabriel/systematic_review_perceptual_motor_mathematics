# Can Perceptual-Motor Training Cause Changes In Mathematical Abilities In Preadolescent Children?
## Code for Statistical Analyses

This repo contains the R files and associated data used for the statistical analyses in the systematic review "Can Perceptual-Motor Training Cause Changes In Mathematical Abilities In Preadolescent Children?".

No dependency management system was used to track versions of the required dependencies. Versions are listed as comments in the code files. The results presented in the paper were produced using R version 4.0.2.

```effect_sizes.r``` contains the code for calculating the effect sizes and confidence intervals, and producing the associated figures.

```task_properties_distribution.r``` contains the code for evaluating the similarities and differences between the intervention properties in the included studies.

```type_ii_error_probabilities.r``` contains the code used to compute the type-II error probability as a function of effect size in each included study, together with the code to produce the associated plot.
